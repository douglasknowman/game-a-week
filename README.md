# A Game a Week
These are games of a series where i create a game a week and publish the code here
on my gitHub account, I have a [blog in Portuguese](http://www.douglasknowman.blogspot.com)
which i write and post gameplay videos of the games. If you just want to
watch the videos, subscribe on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/srDouglasSilva).

If you play some games, consider send me a feedback by email with the number of the week
to identify which game you play.: [douglasknowman@gmail.com](mailto:douglasknowman@gmail.com).
